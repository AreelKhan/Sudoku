# Sudoku
A Sudoku puzzle and integrated solver written using Pygame


This project started off as an attempt at answering Leetcode 37.Sudoku Solver. 

link: https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/

I solved the problem using the Backtracking algorithm. Although I thought of many algorithms to solve a Sudoku board, the backtracking algorithm seemed the most efficient,
elegant and easy to implement.

How to play:

Run the SudokuGame.py file.

A Sudoku GUI will pop-up

Enter a value by left-clicking the square and entering an integer from 1-9 inclusive.

If you want to see the solution, press s on the keyboard.
