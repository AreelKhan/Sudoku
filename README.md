# Sudoku
A Sudoku puzzle and integrated solver written using Pygame


This project started off as an attempt at answering Leetcode 37.Sudoku Solver. 
link:https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/
I solved the problem using the Backtracking algorithm. Although I thought of many algorithms to solve a Sudoku board, the backtracking algorithm seemed the most efficient,
elegant and easy to implement.

How to play:
Run the SudokuGame.py file.
A Sudoku GUI will pop-up
Enter a value by left-clicking the square and entering an integer from 1-9 inclusive.
If you want to see the solution, press s on the keyboard.
